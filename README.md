> I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times. -- Bruce Lee

Katas (ÂΩ¢) are practiced in martial arts as a way to internalize and perfect techniques, so they can be executed and adapted under various circumstances without much hesitation. Let's try something similar with Go programming. Go katas is a small set of [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/gokatas/repositories) containing small Go programs that are correct (true), practical (good), clear and simple (beautiful). The practice workflow is straightforward:

0. Install and run the gokatas tool

```
docker run --rm -it golang /bin/bash # optional; to practice inside a container d≈çj≈ç :-)
go install github.com/gokatas/gokatas@latest
gokatas
```

1. Select one of the Go katas and clone it; you might start with the smallest one (`gokatas -sortby lines`)

```
git clone https://github.com/gokatas/bcounter.git # or git@github.com:gokatas/bcounter.git
cd bcounter
```

2. **Read** the documentation and code and **meditate** upon it (use included links, search engine or AI if you get stuck)

```
go doc -all
go doc io.Writer
vi main.go # apt update && apt install vim
```

3. Delete the code in a file and try to **write** it back. Check how you are doing

```
go run main.go
go test # in folders where <package>_test.go is present
git diff
```

Repeat the read-meditate-write cycle until you feel comfortable with the kata. At that point stop practicing it and move on to the next kata. It's important to practice regularly because repetition creates habits, and habits are what enable mastery. Start by taking baby steps. Set a goal that you can meet and insert it into your daily routines. For example, practice 10 minutes every working day before lunch. At first it's fine even if you only read through one of the katas. After some time it will require much less will power to practice. Your programming moves will start looking simpler and smoother. ü•ã
