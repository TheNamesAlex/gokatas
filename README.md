# Go katas

Katas (å½¢) are practiced in martial arts as a way to internalize and perfect the techniques so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances,
without thought or hesitation. Let's try the same with Go code.

The approach is pretty low-tech. Go katas is a set of [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/gokatas/repositories) containing brief, well written Go programs. Select one of them and try to understand it. Then be rewriting it partially or from scratch until you feel comfortable with it. Use `git diff` to see how you are doing.

There's a command to show all the katas:

```
$ go install github.com/gokatas/gokatas@latest

$ gokatas
Name     Size  Stars  Topics                        URL
----     ----  -----  ------                        ---
shift    1     0      []                            https://github.com/gokatas/shift
areader  1     0      []                            https://github.com/gokatas/areader
boring   3     0      [channels goroutines select]  https://github.com/gokatas/boring
```

It's important to practice regularly because repetition creates habits, and habits are what enable mastery. Start by taking baby steps. Set a goal that you
can meet, e.g. 10 minutes every day before work. At first it's fine even if you only read through one of the beginner level katas. Use documentation, a search
engine or an AI model if you don't understand something. After some time it will require much less will power to practice. Your programming moves will start
looking simpler and smoother. If you feel comfortable enough with a kata, stop practicing it and pick another one that interests you and is slightly beyond
your current ability.
